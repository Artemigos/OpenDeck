# OpenDeck

This is a **very** early version, basically a POC at this point. You have been warned.

OpenDeck aims to be an open software (and communication standard) for devices known as "stream decks", which function as macro keyboards with visual feedback for the user about current functions performed by the key (sceens on each key).

While this could eventually be implemented on a real device, the initial goal is to use your touch devices (phone, tablet, etc.) as keyboards.

More details will come when the project takes shape.
